I knew your existence since at least 5 years ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even though I have to be honest that your art-style is not my cup of tea, there are some stuff that I think you are really good at, such as really complicated line art designs. That is something that I couldn't really do. Well done in that part. However I sometimes really wonder, how did you do that? It looks so... unnatural and mechanical, it's not organic. Everything looks so symmetric that it just makes it look unnatural.<br /><br /><br />I really wish you have improved within all these years, but from my view, the improvement is really minimal. Anyways, I hope your break in Deviantart is temporary, and I hope that next time when i see your art, it will be much better than now.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wish you good luck.&nbsp;",
