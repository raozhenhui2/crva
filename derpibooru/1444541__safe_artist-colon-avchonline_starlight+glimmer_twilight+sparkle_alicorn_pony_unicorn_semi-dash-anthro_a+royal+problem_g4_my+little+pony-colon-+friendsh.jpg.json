    "description": "Hello,everypony, give me new greeting and my new artwork.\n \nIt’s Season 7 a bit while, and I heaven’t seen the new episode. The 10th episode actually, A royal problem. I was just keep doing what I’m doing, making new orchestra project, school works stuff.\n \n \n \nBut just after these past few days, many of my friends and some of my fans came to me and said…\n \n“Hey, Sean~ do you see the new episode? It’ awesome and it has your ballet academy series artwork reference!”\n \nor “yo, avchonline, the new episode had some fandom relativeed tribute image, and your on it! ”\n \nthis kind of stuff and I was like “…you are fxxking kidding me right..? -_-”\n \n \n \nBut anyway, since many people encourage me to watch the new episode , why not? (I don’t capture episode by live,  I usually watch it after few weeks later. and i really not quite catch every episode for a lot of things need to do)\n \n \n \nSo I watch it, and… yay, this episode it’s indeed some kind of interesting. And I do see the fandom reference to ….well, not me. The solar flare (nightmare Celestia, i hope i spell it correctly )actually, and looking at eqd discution , they do have many said the reference of the solar flare.\n \n \n \nI can understand what you guys talking about when you say the “Referencs to me.”, the ballet TS and ballet SG, actually it's the artwork i drew it years ago, and being posted by my friend Kinda-l (his English are not good so please forgive him for those weird describation below his gallery.) \nright here \n[you love me,you don't love me](http://kinda-l.deviantart.com/art/you-love-me-you-don-t-love-me-616321592)\n \nthey did looks kind of sweet, and I do appreciate your supporting me that way,but I’m not sure ,or should I said, I’m very doubt that it was the reference to me, but… I did kind of wish it was, hey? Who said a man can’t dream, can I ? **little sigh**\n \n \n \nBut anyway, why I’m talking all these nonsence, is that I do not count on Hasbro “tribute” the ballet reference to me, but. I do count on this sence give me a new inspiration to drewing the brand new artwork for CRBAseries,\n \n \n \nSo here we go , this “Sweet as a cake, smooth as a minuet”\n \n \n \nThe reason I named that way is this is kind of rhythm, you can imaging the bouncing and skipping little world of the two girls having (in the academy actually),little Starlight glimmer staind on the huge ,sweet pancakes (it took me a lot of time to drew the linging of the pancake ), with the academy card on it, and TS just standing on a delicated golden music box, and I redesign it more golden and more detailed , to composed the French rococo style feeling in it, and I do the same design with TS’s brand new ballet dress.\n \n \n \nSG are wearing the same outfit with her “Senpai” because in this episode they do wear the same outfit, and I trying to drewing the position like Ts is going to hold SG up from those huge pancake (or maybe they are small?) to the box and maybe hold her in her arm or something…., Oops sorry, getting a little off topic , this is not shipping artwork. Lol\n \n \n \nI trying to light up th background, like some kind of light colored birthday card, and because of the title of the episode, I give using Celestia and Luna’s color and cutie mark to decorate the frame \nand i was working on a new ballet orchestra piece for this lovely little ballet partner (or ..if you ship them.. whatever.), kind of being inspired by E.Stravinsky. just wait for my news about it than i'll show you guys\n \n \n \nThis artwork was actually drewing in my commission’s specification(except the background.), so you can see the artwork and figure out if you want to ask for commission from me what it might be looks like. and if this artwork get enough supporting, I will make the bonus artwork for it (the academy live series ,as usual.)\n \n \n \nAnd this dialogue is going to be very interesting … maybe.\n \nAnyway, thanks for supporting and I’ll see you guys next time.\n \n  \nPS: poor little Starlight could will be having a long ,hard time for eating pancakes..XD \nPSS: notice that TS got herself a new,lovely tights? <3\n \nSean.M",
