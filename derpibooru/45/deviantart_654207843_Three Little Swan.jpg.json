            "body": "And then always those farfetched explanations of people trying to feminize her when you point out how she has not the slightest interest in wearing dresses.....<br /><br /><br />First, at the Gala, there is a dress code. Without meeting that, you don't get in. This is very common for events like this and won't be any different in Equestria. She wanted to see the Gala, but there's no getting in without wearing a dress. So she had no choice than to bite into that sour apple.<br /><br />Second, Sweetie's play, this wasn't a dress. This was a stage costume in an archaic style. Additionally, this play was a school project (much as like the fashion show we saw in \"Simple Ways\", where she wore a dress to, was a school project as well, for the Ponyville Days festival, so she had again no choice than to wear that; clarifying this before you bring this up, too). Even IF she hated to wear that costume, she again had to because it was a school project and partially, probably also agreed with it because she wanted to help Sweetie Belle with her play, so she brought that sacrifice.<br /><br /><br />Neither of these things mean that she likes to wear such kitschy, girly dresses. She simply was forced to wear them or brought a sacrifice for a friend.<br />Scootaloo hates wearing dresses guts. This is, like, written all over her personality. She isn't a typical girl and that is what makes her, her.<br />Of course, starry-eyed feminists ignore that and come up with all sorts of crap reasons why she just has to like wearing dresses and doing girly things, because she is a GIRL and all girls just are like this, which is how such pictures like this one happen then.<br />It's sick, stereotypical yakshit supported by old-fashioned feminists who refuse to go with the time and rather force something on Scootaloo, than accepting who she is.",

On the contrary she even liked to wear them to the gala. <br /><br />If you take Rainbow Dash on the other side, she has shown disgust wearing a dress and she couldn't wait to get out of it with the wedding.<br /><br />Scootaloo is just a girl who wouldn't wear dresses out of free choice but that doesn't mean that she hates wearing them. <br /><br />There are still normal women out there who behave normally and don't think every guy is a misogynistic bastard. And by the way, feminism would be the opposite of what you're insinuating. True feminists would like women to be EQUAL to men so that means NO difference in clothing.<br /><br />Check your facts before you preach.",

            "body": "Feminism is more than what you are insinuating. It is also the belief that girls should be traditional and \"behave like girls\", aka, only wearing frilly dresses, go to tea parties and play with dolls. Because hating to wear dresses and being out in the mud with your scooter while practicing stunts is something \"only for boys\" and a true girl would never do this. There are types of feminists who actually think that way. Which is EXACTLY the vibe this artist gives here.<br />And this artist isn't the only one either. LeekFish is of the same kind.<br /><br /><br />\"Scootaloo is just a girl who wouldn't wear dresses out of free choice but that doesn't mean that she hates wearing them.\"<br /><br />And that usually means to hate wearing something. Not liking to wear something equals to hating to do it. If she wouldn't hate to wear dresses, we would see her being enthusiastic over wearing dresses, but we never do.<br />The example you listed also doesn't show her liking having to wear a dress for the gala, she only showed to be excited for the Gala itself, for all the shindig that would went down there and that she imagined to be very exciting.<br />This is not my interpretation either. This is something directly coming from her mouth, when she spoke about being excited for the Gala.<br />And at no point she expressed any fancy for the dress she was wearing. It was a necessary evil for her, nothing more.",

            "body": "This discussion is getting tiring..... The point I'm making is, that there are some artists who reach for the assumption that Scootaloo has to like wearing dresses because she's a girl, even though every single thing about her personality speaks for it that she despises dresses, alongside everything else that is girly of nature, or who feel threatened by the imagination that a girl could not like to wear dresses.<br />So they go and draw Scootaloo OOC and in dresses, which is either a crazy attempt to send an overtly feminist message or their way of coping with the fact that Scootaloo diverts from the typical girl image that is stuck in their heads.<br />And this artist here is one of those. And by your arguments, it is apparent that you apply this classical and stereotype girl model to Scootaloo too, because you really fight it that I say she doesn't like to wear dresses, despite that we have never seen her saying that she likes dresses or expressing that in any other way.<br />And the dictionary link you give her is fawlty, because it does not list the type of feminism I spoke about.<br />Call that \"radical feminism\" if you want..... But it's a part of feminism nonetheless. There are actually people who think in such an old-fashioned way, if you believe that or not.",

There is no such thing as the kind you're talking about. The thing you are talking about is called conservatism, the&nbsp;political and social philosophy that promotes retaining traditional social institutions in the context of culture and civilization.<br /><br />And no, I don't apply the classical stereotype that a girl MUST wear dresses because, as I said, I'm a girl who doesn't like to wear dresses. Are you really that blind to not have read that sentence? You're saying this discussion is tiring but that's because it's not going the way you want to.",

We should afford some terms to distinct the different types of it. \"Radical feminism\" is a very good one to describe the belief that every girl has to like dresses, I think.<br /><br /><br />\"Are you really that blind to not have read that sentence?\"<br /><br />I did see it.

            "body": "We really have to go to the basics with this, aren't we?<br /><br />\"Feminists\", no matter how you define that term, are women who are interested in standing in for the rights of women and girls and generally value female lifestyle.<br />And that might be all nice and noble..... But every group has radical members. If you believe it or not (and you can call this \"conservative\" as much as you desire, I'm not even objecting this), there are radical feminists (or \"feminazis\", as you call them) as well, feminists who already deem it as a violation of women/girl rights if women or girls get portrayed as manly/boyish.<br />Probably because they hate to think of it that the line can blur there or simply because they are indeed crazy enough to believe that acting like a boy/man defies the meaning of being a girl/woman. Or because they believe that men ignore the true nature of women if they claim women can be manly or some yakshit like that..... Whatever. I'm not wasting my time analyzing what goes on in the crazy heads of such people.<br />And among pony artists, those women always reveal themselves easily by drawing Scoots in a girlish way that completely ignores her personality and interests and by acting incredibly offended and defensive if you tell them that their portrayal of Scoots is OOC and why. And even more so if you tell them how \"manly\" Scoots is and that she isn't a typical girl.<br />Their arguments are always the same as well, \"But Scoots is a girl, why can't she like it to wear a dress?\", \"We've seen her enjoying wearing a dress!\" (and even reach for blatant lies with that one), \"She never said she hates to wear dresses!\", ect. ect.<br />Again, believe it or not, but every group has its radical members and so do feminists. And with how defensive you already got here about me saying that Scoots hates to wear dresses and tried to prove me she likes to wear dresses, I can see you falling into the same niche.<br />Even so much that you resorted to insult me by saying I'm stuck in my own little world. Which is fine with me, that world is better as the one you're stuck in.<br />Anyway, since you did insult me (and are apparently run out of arguments anyway because of this), I will leave this discussion now.
